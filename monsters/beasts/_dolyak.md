Dolyaks are animals that are domesticated for hauling luggage, and are most often seen in supply caravans. Their natural habitat is the Shiverpeak Mountains, though with proper care they can survive a wide range of environments.

Wild dolyaks are known to abandon any calves that are perceived as being weak. They are also known to, upon the time of natural end of their life, instinctively wander to a graveyard site (one of them being located in Wildspine Hills) to die, similar to a real world myth about elephant graveyards.
