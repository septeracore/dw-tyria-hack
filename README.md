# Welcome to Tyria!

## What's this about?
This is intended as a Dungeon World Hack set in the world of Guild Wars.
The world (and one of it's continents) is called Tyria.
It should be more then just playbooks for the professions in Guild Wars to be played as classes in Dungeon World.

When finished it will contain:
* Stats for the monsters present in Guild Wars
* Professions (classes in Dungeon World) for all professions in Guild Wars.
* Descriptions of all playable races in Guild Wars.
* Descriptions of all non-playable races in Guild Wars.
* maybe even descriptions of the world of tyria

## Guild Wars 2 or Guild Wars 1
For starters Guild Wars 2 should be easier to implement.
There's no multiclassing to think about and most of the players are more familiar with the world 250 years after the events of GW1.
Also there's dragons to slay!

After this is done I will for sure work on something for the GW1 setting.
More professions, less races and multiclassing as an essential feature of the character progression.
And Dwarfs!

## ETA?
There's no ETA yet, at the moment I'm looking for willing people to help out with the creation and later probably playtesting on roll20.net or with local groups.

## What is left to be done?
Nearly everything, I created this repository and filled it with nothing. Really, most of the markdown files listed are empty for now. I wanted to get the structure for the repo going. The profession files are at least filled with a template to hold the information needed for them. As soon as I get to it I'll do the same with races and monsters.

Files that actually have content:
* README.md
* LICENSE.md
* professions (classes)/mesmer.md

## Where to talk about this?
There's a subreddit that can be used: http://www.reddit.com/r/dwtyriahack
