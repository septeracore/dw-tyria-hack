## Starting Moves

### Mirror Mirror
You create mirror images of yourself, which will mirror your movement or follow simple commands. Images cannot do damage; if you would take a hit, roll randomly to see if you are hit or an image is hit. Images last for only a few minutes, if an image would take damage in any way, that image breaks.

When you create mirror images of yourself, lose all existing images and roll +INT. "On a 10+, you generate three images. "On a 7-9, you generate only one mirror image and choose 1:

* You draw unwanted attention to yourself
* Until you have time to rest, you can create one less image (limit one)
* You take a -1 to Mirror Mirror until you make camp or rest for the night.

### Mind Sear 
When you draw a bead of purple light from your weapon to the enemy, burning their thoughts, roll +DEX. "On a 10+, you do your damage to the opponent and they grant a +1 forward to the next attack. "On a 7-9, choose 1:

* You deal your damage
* The enemy grants +1 forward to the next attack
* Both, but you draw unwanted attention to yourself or put yourself in a spot

### Mirror Break
When you shatter the images of yourself on an enemy, roll +INT. "On a 10+, pick one per image broken. "On a 7-9, pick per image broken, but you draw unwanted attention to yourself (You can choose the same option multiple times):

* The enemy takes -1 armor forward
* The enemy is stunned momentarily
* The enemy takes 1d4 damage (ignores armor)


## Advanced Moves

#### Minor Illusion 
When you enter the mind of an intelligent target and send illusionary images to his brain, roll +INT. "On a 10+, pick 2. "On a 7-9 pick 1.

* The target is paralyzed by fear.
* The target takes 1d4 damage (ignores armor).
* The illusion covers one sense (sight, hearing, etc.) for a short time after the illusion is gone.
* The target flees form the illusion.
* The illusion is seen by a group of NPCs rather than just one.

#### Controlled Images 
If you have at least one image close to you and you would take damage, instead of rolling randomly you can choose to have an image take the 
damage. If you do the image breaks.

#### Mirror Tricks 
When you swap places with one of the images that you have created, roll 
+DEX. "10+ you do it, no problems. "7-9 either anyone who can see you 
notices the swap or the swap breaks the image.

that the image could see, hear, and feel and can *Discern Realities* through this image. You may also speak through the image. If the image would take 
damage while you are linked, you take a 1d4 damage (ignores armor) and the 
image breaks. You can end the link at any time with a minor effort of will.

gain 1d4 health as well.
