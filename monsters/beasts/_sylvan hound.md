Sylvan Hounds are dogs, born from the Pale Tree. Unlike the sylvari, Sylvan Hounds are born small and grow in a few months. They are naturally docile and great companions but when mistreated by Nightmare Court they are turned into aggressive Nightmare Hounds.

Packmaster Danador in The Verdence in Caledon Forest is taking care of some in his kennel, with the help of Apprentice Madoine.
