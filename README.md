# Welcome to Tyria!

## What's this about?
This is intended as a Dungeon World Hack set in the World of Guild Wars.
The world (and one of it's continents) is called Tyria.
It should be more then just playbooks for the professions in Guild Wars to be played as classes in Dugeon World.
When finished it will contain:
* Stats for the monsters present in Guild Wars
* Professions (classes in Dungeon World) for all professions in Guild Wars.
* Descriptions of all playable races in Guild Wars.
* Descriptions  of all non-playable races in Guild Wars.
* maybe even descriptions of the world of tyria

## Guild Wars 2 or Guild Wars 1
For starters Guild Wars 2 should be easier to implement. There's no multi classing to think about and most of the players are more familiar with the world 250 years after the events of GW1.
Also there's dragons to slay!
After this is done I will for sure work on something for the GW1 setting.
More professions, less races and multi classing as an essential feature of the character progression.
And Dwarfs!

## ETA?
There's no ETA yet, at the moment we're looking for willing people to help out with the creation and later probably playtesting on roll20.net or with local groups.
