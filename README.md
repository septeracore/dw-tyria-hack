# Welcome to Tyria!

## What's this about?

## Guild Wars 2 or Guild Wars 1
For starters Guild Wars 2 should be easier to implement. There's no multi classing to think about and most of the players are more familiar with the world 250 years after the events of GW1.
Also there's dragons to slay!
After this is done I will for sure work on something for the GW1 setting.
More professions, less races and multi classing as an essential feature of the character progression.
And Dwarfs!

## ETA?
There's no ETA yet, at the moment we're looking for willing people to help out with the creation and later probably playtesting on roll20.net or with local groups.
