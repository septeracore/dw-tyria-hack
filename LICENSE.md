# License

What license to use needs to be discussed.

The GW2 and GW1 Wiki use the [Gnu Free Documentation License 1.2](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html).
* [Guild Wars Wiki: Copyrights](http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:Copyrights)
* [Guild Wars 2 Wiki: Copyrights](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Copyrights)

But only the user generated content falls under this license.
Rights for other content remains with ArenaNet or NCsoft, this might include some ability names, races and monsters.

The word Tyria and the profession names should be exempt from that as they have other uses.

An e-mail to ArenaNet should help with that, but I think  more content is needed to form a clearer picture of what is being created here.

Dungeon World itself is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and uses content under the [Open Game License](http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf).
